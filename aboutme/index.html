				He is a senior Computer Science major at Georgetown College in Georgetown, KY. At the 
				college, he is a resident advisor, on the men's golf team, and assists with A/V in the campus' events.

				He was born in Atlanta and raised in Riverdale, Georgia. His little brother and sister are twins and born
				in the year 2000. Growing up he was always interested in electronics, following in the footsteps of his
				father. He spent much of his time after school across Atlanta volunteering and learning at the Fernbank Science
				Center with a thrown together group of high school robotoics enthusiasts who called themselves the Fernbank LINKSters.

				However, Cam enjoyed playing mostly baseball and basketball growing up. When he turned 11 years
				old he joined the First Tee of Atlanta where he learned to play golf, traveled, spoke, and played
				tournament golf through high school and college.
